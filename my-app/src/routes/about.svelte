	<h1>About this app</h1>

	<p>
		This is a <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev">SvelteKit</a> app. You can make your own by typing the
		following into your command line and following the prompts:
	</p>

	<!-- TODO lose the @next! -->
	<pre>npm init svelte@next</pre>

	<p>
		The page you're looking at is purely static HTML, with no client-side interactivity needed.
		Because of that, we don't need to load any JavaScript. Try viewing the page's source, or opening
		the devtools network panel and reloading.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong> This part of the app is simple. I did not change anything, as there is nothing to learn here. It is pure HTML, through and through.
		I could add some JavaScript type elements to this, but I will do that on what was originally the TODO page.
		I am going to change the name of this page to My Toy.</strong>
	</p>

	<p>
		The <a href="/todos">TODOs</a> page illustrates SvelteKit's data loading and form handling. Try using
		it with JavaScript disabled!
